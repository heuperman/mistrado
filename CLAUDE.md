# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- **Build**: `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript to `dist/` directory
- **Development**: `npm run dev` - Runs TypeScript compiler in watch mode
- **Test/Lint**: `npm run test` - Runs prettier, xo linter, and ava tests

## Architecture Overview

This is an Ink-based CLI application that provides a conversational interface to Mistral AI's API. The application uses React components to render a terminal UI and provides built-in filesystem and search tools.

### Core Flow

The app initializes two main systems concurrently:

1. **Mistral API client** - for AI conversations
2. **Tool Manager** - provides built-in filesystem and search tools

When users submit prompts, the app:

1. Sends message + available tools to Mistral API
2. If AI responds with tool calls, executes them via Tool Manager
3. Returns tool results to continue the conversation
4. Displays streaming responses in real-time terminal UI

### Modular Architecture

The codebase follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Components

- **App** (`source/app.tsx`): Lightweight orchestration component that coordinates hooks, services, and user interactions
- **CLI Entry** (`source/cli.tsx`): Simple entry point that renders the App component
- **Conversation** (`source/components/conversation.tsx`): Reusable component for displaying conversation history with message type styling
- **Login** (`source/components/login.tsx`): Secure API key input and storage interface
- **Hero** (`source/components/hero.tsx`): Welcome/branding display
- **Loading** (`source/components/loading.tsx`): Loading indicator with token progress display
- **Markdown** (`source/components/markdown.tsx`): Markdown rendering component

#### Custom Hooks

- **useAppState** (`source/hooks/use-app-state.ts`): Centralized state management for services, conversation, loading states, and initialization logic
- **useSignalHandler** (`source/hooks/use-signal-handler.ts`): Process signal handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM) and graceful shutdown coordination

#### Services Layer

- **ConversationService** (`source/services/conversation-service.ts`): Handles AI interactions, tool calling, and conversation flow with callback-based architecture
- **MistralService** (`source/services/mistral-service.ts`): Manages Mistral AI client and streaming responses using configurable model (defaults to `devstral-small-2507`)
- **ToolManager** (`source/services/tool-manager.ts`): Manages built-in tools, handles tool registration and execution
- **SecretsService** (`source/services/secrets-service.ts`): Secure API key storage via system keychain (keytar)

#### Command System

- **CommandHandler** (`source/commands/command-handler.ts`): Encapsulates slash command logic, aliases, descriptions, and execution

#### Utilities

- **App Utils** (`source/utils/app-utils.ts`): Shared utility functions like git repository detection
- **Converters** (`source/utils/converters.ts`): Bidirectional conversion between Mistral and MCP formats
- **Git** (`source/utils/git.ts`): Git repository utilities
- **Gitignore** (`source/utils/gitignore.ts`): Gitignore parsing and matching
- **Paths** (`source/utils/paths.ts`): Path utilities and resolution
- **Regex** (`source/utils/regex.ts`): Regular expression utilities
- **Validation** (`source/utils/validation.ts`): Input validation utilities

### Built-in Tool System

The app uses a **ToolManager** service (`source/services/tool-manager.ts`) that provides filesystem operation and search tools:

- **edit**: String replacement in files
- **glob**: File search by glob pattern
- **grep**: Content search by regex pattern
- **ls**: Directory listing with glob ignore patterns
- **multi-edit**: Multiple edits in sequence
- **read**: File content reading with offset/limit
- **write**: File creation/overwriting

Tool implementations are in `source/tools/` with each tool having its own file (e.g., `edit.ts`, `read.ts`, `grep.ts`).

### Type System & Converters

- **Mistral Types** (`source/types/mistral.ts`): Mistral API message and tool types
- **MCP Types** (`source/types/mcp.ts`): MCP protocol types for tool definitions

### Key Patterns

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Custom React Hooks**: Encapsulate complex state logic and side effects
- **Callback Pattern**: ConversationService uses callbacks for loose coupling with UI state
- **React Component Composition**: Reusable components with readonly props following React best practices
- **Centralized State Management**: useAppState hook manages all application state in one place
- **Streaming responses** from Mistral API with real-time UI updates
- **Slash commands** (`/help`, `/usage`, `/logout`, `/exit`, `/quit`) for session management
- **Conversation history** maintained as `MistralMessage[]` array with system prompt injection
- **Graceful shutdown** handling via signal handlers
- **Tool execution results** fed back into conversation for AI followup
- **Prefer types over interfaces** for type definitions
- **Boolean prop naming**: Use `isLoading` instead of `loading` for clarity

### System Prompt

The system prompt (`source/prompts/system.ts`) configures the AI as "Mistrado" with specific behavior patterns:

- Concise responses (â‰¤4 lines unless detail requested)
- Direct answers without preamble/postamble
- File path references with `file_path:line_number` format
- Security-focused (refuse malicious code requests)

### Security Notes

- API keys stored securely via keytar (system keychain)
- No API keys or secrets should be committed to the repository
- System prompt includes malicious code detection and refusal
